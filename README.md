# Introduction to spatial capture-recapture

Code accompanying a talk "A practical introduction to SCR in R" given in the Snow Leopard Network Summer Exchange program on 11 July 2023. 

The easiest way to use the code in this repo is to copy the repo (download .zip), unzip on your machine, open the .Rproj file (requiring RStudio). Then to recreate the slide deck run *SCRslides.qmd* or run the scripts in *01-survey-design.R* and *02-data-analysis.R*, which reproduce the analysis in the slides without the additional images and text.
